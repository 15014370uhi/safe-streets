Do the following steps on the source machine:
workon [environment_name]
pip freeze > requirements.txt
copy requirements.txt to other PC
On the other PC:
create a virtual environment using mkvirtualenv [environment_name]
workon [environment_name]
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usually I use virtualenv to create a new environment, then I go to the environment where I want to copy from, copy all the folders and paste it into the environment folder I just created, but most importantly when asking if you want to replace the Destination files, choose to skip these files. This way you keep your settings. At least for me, this has worked very well. I hope it works for you too.
